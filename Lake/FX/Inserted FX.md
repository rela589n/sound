Inserted FX only makes sense for NON-time-based (not delays, reverbs, choruses etc) effects. For instance, [[Vintage compressor]], [[Lake/De-esser]], [[Equalizer]] etc. This is because original sound is not mixed with effect, but rather FX is inserted before channel strip, so that sound is already modified.

It is connected directly to the channel or a bus.

> Non-time-based effects (compressors, de-essers, gates) must be inserted!
