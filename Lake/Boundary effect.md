Here's what happens when sound wave reflects the wall:

Points, which have 1/4, 3/4, 5/4 wavelengh etc are static after reflection. These are called [[Boundary effect|SBIR Nodes]]. If speaker is placed on the node, **wave will cancel itself**.

On the other other hand, points which have 1/2, 2/2, 3/2, etc cause positive interferention, hence we'll have peak or **boost in some frequencies**.
