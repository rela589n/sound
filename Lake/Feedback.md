Volume and frequency levels - culprits of feedback.

**NEVER** Use [[GEQ]] or [[PEQ]] on master bus along with [[RTA]] to eliminate the feedback:

> Before the show, provoke the feedback to find out which frequency causes it and cut down on this frequency.

Since we take out some frequencies, this is fraught with not only taking out the feedback, but also screw up the sound of instruments, which need these frequencies.

As an trade-off solution, we may introduce a bus for mics, and eq this bus, not to eq everything else. We should be doing surgical cuts, not to mess a lot with sound.
