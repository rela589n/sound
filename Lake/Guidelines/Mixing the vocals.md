## Setting the gain

Turn off compression, reset eq (we would like to eq only when we have instrumental accompaniment), mute effects.

Also, adress [[Feedback]] if it shows up.

Then set up solid gain (-18dBFS).

## Adjust [[HPF]]

**100Hz** is a good start point for vocals. It will remove all [[Low-end]] stage noise, bass guitar and drums. Also, it helps out to remove [[Vocal Plosives]].

## Equalize the vocal
