**Knee** - smoothness (softness) of sound compression, its transition. 

## Hard knee

**Hard knee** - the gain reduction applies **right away** with **full compression** ratio when the signal exceeds the threshold.

This is good for instruments with fast peaks (drums, guitar). 

## Soft knee

**Soft knee** - the gain reduction applies **gradually** until reaching full  compression ratio. With soft knee, compression starts somewhat before reaching the threshold. 

Soft knee is good for vocals.
