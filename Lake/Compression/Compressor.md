Compressor narrows down dynamic range making loud sounds quiter. We can control the [[Transient|transients]] - how sharp will these be, and how fast will be the fade.

**Compression of dirty input** will produce even dirtier output. For instance, echo after compression will become even more louder.

- [[Compressing bass]].
