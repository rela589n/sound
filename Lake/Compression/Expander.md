Expander is the opposite of the compressor. It expands the dynamic range of the signal, thereby making soft sounds even softer. 


Gate is similar to the expander, but gate works with decibles, while expander works with a ratio. With gate we set how many decibels we want the sound below the threshold to be softer.
