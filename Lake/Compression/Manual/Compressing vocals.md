When doing monitors from [[Terms|Front of House]], you don't want the vocalists to hear compressed sound from the monitors, since they will always ask to turn up the monitor level.

The goal of vocal compresion is to **smooth the peaks**.

## Ratio

The [[Compression Ratio]] of 2:1 (light) or 3:1 (most common) is good option to start with. The ratio of 6:1 is considered to be aggressive.

## Threshold

Gain reduction should be around 6dB - not to suck the life from vocal.

## Gain

Gain is intended to make up the sound level reduced by compression. If there're in/out level meters, we should set gain so that these meters meet. Otherwise, gain is set to the number, which GR meter continuously doesn't fall under (3 in the example below).

## Attack & Release

The best option is to use "Auto time":

## PS

On live performance you'd not be agressive with compression. 
If you were doing recording, you could've compressed tighter.
