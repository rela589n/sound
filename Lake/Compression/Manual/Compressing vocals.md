When doing monitors from [[Terms|Front of House]], you don't want the vocalists to hear compressed sound from the monitors, since they will always ask to turn up the monitor level.

The goal of vocal compresion is to **smooth the peaks**.

## Ratio

The [[Compression Ratio]] of 2:1 or 3:1 is good option to start with.

## Threshold

Gain reduction should be around 6dB - not to suck the life from vocal.

## Attack & Release

The best option is to use "Auto time":

## PS

On live performance you'd not be agressive with compression. 
If you were doing recording, you could've compressed tighter.
