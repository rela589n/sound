De-esser - the tool, which is used to reduce the loudness of [[Sibilant|sibilant sound]]. Too much de-essing makes sound  [[Muffled sound|muffled]].

There are two parameters:
- cutoff frequency - de-esser starts analysis only starting from this frequency;
- threshold.

The flow to configure the de-esser is following:
- enable listen button to listen what is being de-essed;
- adjust threshold and cutoff frequency so that we in listen we hear only sibilance, not the actual words.

The amount of de-essing should be moderate, since we are used to hear esses naturally in real life.
