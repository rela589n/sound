**Volume** uses resistor to **reduce** the initial signal level. It doesn't increase the initial signal.

**Gain** conversely, it does **increase** the initial [[Amplitude]] of the signal so that it becomes louder. Gain may cause distortion when amplitude crosses the `-0` threshold (overloaded signal).
