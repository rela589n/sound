The sound sent to the bus might be:
- **Input** means input **signal right after the gain**
- **Pre  EQ** - signal **after gate**;
- **Post EQ** - signal **after EQ**;
- **Pre  Fader** - signal **after compressor**;
- **Post Fader** - singal **after fader**;

For monitor bus we definitely don't want to send (vocalists):
- **Post Fader**, since change in FOH would affect monitor.
- **Pre Fader**, since it includes compression, while vocalists poorly get compressed sound, and might ask to turn up the monitor.
