### Usability

Auto mix allows us to have group of **microphones semi-muted**, while one of them is used to talk through. This is useful to **reduce the noise** in situations when we can't mute the microphones (panel discussion).

In a single auto mix group **only one microphone** is considered to be **active** (which some speaker is currently talking in). When it's necessary to have two active microphones, we'd need to have them in separate auto mix groups.

### Difference with channel Gate

We can setup gate on each channel and it will definitely reduce the noise. Though, Auto Mix is somewhat different - it doesn't just add the gate on the channel, it gates other channels of the same group, while some particular microphone is active (talken with).

### Last gate function

When single person is speaking for a long time, it makes sense to use "Last Gate" function. When speaker pauses for a while, gain reduction will not apply to the microphone, since it is the last spoken to mic.
