DCA (Digitally Controlled Amplifier) groups allow us to group channels so that we'll have a single fader to bring group level up or down.

There's no separate layer of DCA in the midst of signal flow, compared to [[Subgroup Setup|subgroups]]. IOW, each signal goes right into LR output without intermediary.

What DCA does is applies level change for each channel one by one.
