**Gain should be SET AND FORGET** at the initial soundcheck. Usually we set gain to -18dbFs on digital consoles. The reason for that is because if we change gain during the performance, it would trigger cascade threshold changes in compressors, EQ, FX, etc.

The only reason to change (reduce) gain is when channel is clipping or about to clip.

> Gain is the first thing to adjust.
